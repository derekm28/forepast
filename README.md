Forepast is a historic weather app that allows you to retrieve historical weather data about locations around the world with in the last 7 years. The metaweather API only allows searches within the last 7 yrs.

I chose this project because when i was looking to find weather info about a vacation destination from last year it was very difficult to find so i decided to make it myself.

We have pre-set popular locations that you can query data for any date within the past 7 years. When a date is selected, the get request is made to the API and the results are displayed on the next page.

The same goes for the manually entered locations at the bottom of the page.

The title of the site is named Forepast.

I used Python, html, flask, and postgreSQL to complete this application
